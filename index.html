                <p>Would you rather have a lifetime of regret, or an afternoon of mild disappointment?
                    Either way this is the app for you! <br>Moody Foodie was created for fans of Bob's Burgers. No, Like seriously, 
                    if you're not a fan, this app isnt for you, So <strong>SCRAM!</strong><br> Okay now that they are gone, let me tell you about
                    this app. <br>Have you ever been watching Bob's Burgers and heard a characters voice and thought "That voice sounds so familiar.
                    Who is that?" Well, you’re not alone. <br> This app has a random character generator that will go through all the characters and tell you, 
                    not only who voiced the actor but when they first appeared on the show.<br>If you’re more of a burger connoisseur, then this app is still for you.
                    There is a random burger generator that will go through all the “Burger of the Day” options from the show. See a burger that sounds good enough to eat,
                    well problem solved. Just click on the save button to save the recipe for future BBQing. <br>So, let’s get started, or you could sell your soul. 
                    I did and look at me. I’m fine.
